# dirty computer logger

## background
The Dirty Computer logger is derived from my dissertation project, which examines Janelle Monae's 2018 emotion picture Dirty Computer (a short film accompanying her musical album of the same name) as a methodology for living as a black queer femme subject in a data-controlled state. Within the world of this movie, a "dirty computer" is a person who lives in a way that is out of sync with the desire of a controlling state, and they are taken into custody to be "cleaned," or memory wiped. Monae's character, Jane 87521, has found herself subject to cleaning and having her memory wiped. 

This app imagines a user within this world with the ability to submit dirty computers and their memories to be logged by a central state database (New Dawn Technologies). The user can then "clean" the user, which returns their name after having been cleaned and adds them to the state log of computers. 

## user story

I want to ( log the names and dirty memories of those around me into a database controlled by New Dawn ) 
so that ( my fellow citizens can be 'cleaned' by the state, thereby falling back in line with the status quo and ending their disruption )
